# Couch-Recipe - Example App


__Goal__: Production of a web application simulating a recipe review area.

__Description__:  The web app features a login page (doesn't actually log in or register users) and a recipes page that stores and retrieves recipes details and ratings for particular recipes in a CouchDB database). Clicking on a recipe will display the description and ingredients of the recipe. Clicking on the rating stars will store the rating for the recipe.

__Constraints__: Must use Angular 2, Node.js/Express, and a NoSQL database management system - in this case CouchDB.
